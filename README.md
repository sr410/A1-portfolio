My Portfolio Website
This is my personal portfolio website created for INFR3120 Web and Scripting Programming. It showcases my projects, personal information, and contact details using HTML5 and CSS3. The site is fully responsive, includes a functional contact form, and is deployed on GitHub Pages.
Pages
    • Home – Introduction and navigation links to other pages.
    • About Me – My photo, short introduction, and an embedded video I created.
    • Projects – Five of my projects from previous courses with brief descriptions.
    • Contact Me – Contact form with validation for name, email, and phone.
GUI / Interface
    • Responsive Design – Fluid layouts and media queries for mobile (≤480px), tablet (481–768px), and desktop (≥769px). Separate CSS files are used for each viewport.
    • Gradients – Linear gradient applied to the body on the desktop view.
    • Color Scheme – Created my own scheme: red (#d12929), dark red (#db2c2c), yellow (#bdbd09), and white (#ffffff) for contrast and consistent visual style.
Testing and Validation
    • HTML validated with W3C Markup Validator (minor missing closing tags like </p> were auto-corrected by browsers).
    • CSS validated with W3C CSS Validator.
    • Links checked with W3C Link Checker.
    • Spelling checked using a text editor.
    • Accessibility tested using WAVE.
Version Control
    • Repository is public on GitHub with the complete project structure.
    • Multiple commits demonstrate progress through development stages.
    • Live site: GitHub Pages
External Help
    • Referenced the YouTube channel BroCode for minor HTML/CSS guidance.
    • For my Contact Me form, I used the Mailmodo Email Code Guide as a reference.
    • All videos, images, and other media are created by me.
